\## 🕹️ How the Game Works



\- The computer randomly selects a number within a range (e.g., 1 to 100).

\- The user has to guess the number.

\- After each guess, the program tells whether the guess was:

&nbsp; - Too high 🔼

&nbsp; - Too low 🔽

&nbsp; - Correct 🎉

\- Limited number of attempts (customizable).

\- Optionally shows the number of attempts used and score.

\## 📌 Features

\- Input validation (ensures numeric guesses)

\- Loop for multiple attempts

\- Friendly messages and clean interface
